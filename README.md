HORUS – Hibonite Oxybarometer for Resolving Underlying nebular Structures
HORUS provides a graphical representation of the preliminary nebular model presented in Zanetta et al. (2024, 2025). 
It incorporates precompiled calculations to accurately describe the relationship between Ti oxidation state and oxygen fugacity (fO₂), 
integrating the complex interplay of temperature (T), pressure (P), and chemical composition within the system.

To determine the fO₂ of the solar nebula at the time of mineral formation, the model requires the Ti oxidation state and Ti/Mg ratio of pristine hibonite measured in a CAI.

Important: This model is applicable only to pristine hibonite and should not be used for grains that have undergone thermal reprocessing in the nebula or within parent bodies.

Users can explore a range of parameters to visualize various relationships within the T-P-composition space.

If you use this model, please cite the corresponding publications.
